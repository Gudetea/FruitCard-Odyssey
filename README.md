<h2>FruitCard Odyssey is a fruit personality quiz inspired by the MBTI personality types!</h2><br>
The overall design of this personality quiz is also inspired by personality quizzes such as the Cosmos persona, what cake R U and Innate Traits quiz <br>

This project is quite special to me because this is my first time coding! I was also able to work on the entire quiz by myself, including the illustrations and the test logic. There are still a lot of things I wish I could have done better if I had more time and knew more.<br>
I did not plan on participating in this challenge because I thought I would be incapable of coding a quiz since I had zero coding experience and exams were also this month; thus, I thought that even if I participated, I would not have enough time to finish.<br>
However, I kept thinking about themes for the quiz even though I wasn't planning on making one. I started the process by deciding on a theme and drawing the characters and by then, it was already too late.. I might as well keep going right?<br>
<br>
Anyways, after multiple mental breakdowns, two all-nighters and numerous bubble tea breaks... I present to you, FruitCard Odyssey! (:
